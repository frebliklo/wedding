## Wedding invitation and info

Static with information to the guests of my wedding :D Hosted on Netlify at [sarafrederik.com](https://sarafrederik.com)

## Technologies

The site is built with Gatsby to make it easy to build a static site written in React. The plugin system also makes it possible to easily integrate stuff, that would otherwise require a little more setup.

Styling is done with Emotion because I wanted to experiment with writing object styles as well as having the possibility to write some good old CSS.

Animations are done with Pose which is insanely awesome - if you work with React you need to check it out.

### Local messing around
